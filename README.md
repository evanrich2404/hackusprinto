# MAKE IT RAIN

## Description :memo:
This is a work in progress for our Hack Sprint project around the theme "CLOUDS"
We initially wanted to try out unity and build a game with that. After lots of learning initial set up and colaboration faults, we decided to go with a pygame build to help hopefully eleviate some of those hurdles. This is a simple game where you collect as much rain as possible in the cloud within the time alloted. 



## How to run game:
